##### 名言警句类

Write an essay to explain why "Haste makes waste". 

模板第二段第三段用万能模板 第一段进行替换

As an old saying goes:_______. For us college students, it has an

increasingly important significance: [If you want to achieve something,

you need to take time to do it]. The following reasons can account for

this issue.

First and foremost， there is no doubt that [if you do something in

a very short time you might make some mistakes]. Based on a most recent

survey, it is revealed that a majority of successful social elites

admitted even it’s an easy job, if you want to do it perfectly, it takes

some time. Furthermore, it is obvious that people may doubt you if you

finish your task too quick. Where there is doubt, there is concern. Last

but not least, no one can deny that a great accomplishment is not achieved

in one day. **Although t**he productivity is improved a lot**,** patience is also

necessary.

In a word, if you want to have some achievement, you need to take some

time. Don’t be so haste. If we try out utmost to **slow down and work**

**carefully**, the future of **our careers** will be promising and hopeful. 

俗话说得好:_______。对于我们大学生来说，它有一个越来越重要的意义:如果你想要实现某事，你需要花时间去做它。以下原因

可以解释这个问题。

首先，毫无疑问，如果你在很短的时间内做某事，你可能会犯一些错误。据最近的一项调查结果显示，大部分成功的社会精英承

认，即使这是一项简单的工作，但如果想做得完美，也需要时间。此外，很明显，如果你过快完成任务，人们可能会怀疑你。哪里有怀

疑，哪里就有担忧。最后但并非最不重要的是，没有人能否认，伟大的成就不是一天完成的。虽然工作效率提高了很多，但耐心也是必

要的

总之，如果你想要取得一些成就，你需要一些时间。别这么着急。如果我们尽最大努力放慢速度，认真工作，我们的事业的未来

将是充满希望的。
