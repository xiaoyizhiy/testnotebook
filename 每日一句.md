1.Now the nation's top patent（专利） court appears completely ready to scale back（缩减） on business-method patents, / which have been controversial（有争议的） / ever since they were first authorized 10 years ago.

简化（去掉形容词、副词）：patent（专利） court appears ready to scale back（缩减）

on business-method patents 介词短语为非谓语，简化时先去掉。

which have been controversial 定语从句，根据就近原则修饰business-method patents，have been现在完成时，从过去到现在一直都有争议。

ever since they were first authorized 10 years ago 时间状语从句，自从十年前被授予专利以来
